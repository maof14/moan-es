This repository represents a product showcase page for a company. The project uses further development of Triton-base.

This is a almost done-work in progress. 

## Triton-base
 
A boilerplate for smaller websites or web applications using PHP. Built by Mattias Olsson. 

Triton is a way to keep your code efficient with object oriented PHP and maintain the essentials of OOP - abstraction, encapsulation and inheritance. 

Keep all settings in your config file and let your classes autoload with bootstrap.php. 

Classes are also included for text formatting, image display (resize etc.) and databases with PHP PDO. 

The web template is initially part of a project at Blekinge Tekniska Högskola which has been further developed.
