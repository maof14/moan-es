### Excel SAP Ribbon Add-In

Using our Excel Custom Ribbon template for creating SAP Scripts, SAP automation* has never been easier, and always available when you open Excel. 

**The work process can be as follows:** You have some task that is repetative. For example WBS closing in Project Builder, or the creation of purchase orders. 

You realize that you will be doing this for weeks... 

Instead of doing that, you record the first update and then insert this to our Add-In template, make some updates, maybe if the process is not exactly the same for all cases of updates. 

Insert the recording into the template and sit back with a coffee. Or do something else. 

The best part is that you do not need to be a experienced programmer to make and maintain these kind of scripts. It's that easy, everyone can do it. 

*\*<sub>Your system needs to have SAP Scripting enabled. In almost all cases, it is. See the picture at the bottom of this page to see how it should look.</sub>* 

*Exempel - video eller någonting. Bilder iaf.*

It couldn't be easier. Let us guide you through the steps.

## Other available services

### Other Excel macros

Besides from integrating them in the SAP Ribbon - do you have an idea that you want to automate as an independent script? 

Perhaps one of the following:

* compare reports
* create graphs automatically
* generate reports based on data
* compile information
* synchronize MS Database with Excel
* update MS Access database records or fetch information
* generate templates
* auto-send mails in Outlook
* insert appointments in calendar based on Excel data

* a combination of some of the above or something entirely else?

The possibilities of automation is limitless.
