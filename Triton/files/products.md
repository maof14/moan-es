#### Running the scripts

It couldn't be easier. Let us guide you through the steps.

<div class='row script-preview'>
	<div class='col-md-6'>
		<p class='lead'>Generate a script template by choosing a script to run.</p>
		<p>
			<figure class='border'>
				<img src='img.php?src=select-script.png' alt='Select script' class='img-responsive center-block' />
				<figcaption class='text-center'>Image: Select a script.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class='col-md-6'>
		<p class='lead'>Fill in the script template for as many objects you like.</p>
		<p>
			<figure class='border'>
				<img src='img.php?src=fill-in-script.png' alt='Fill in script' class='img-responsive center-block' />
				<figcaption class='text-center'>Image: Fill in the script.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class='row script-preview'>
	<div class='col-md-6'>
		<p class='lead'>Click the run button.</p>
		<p>
			<figure class='border'>
				<img src='img.php?src=run-script.png' alt='Select script' class='img-responsive center-block' />
				<figcaption class='text-center'>Image: Run the script.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</p>
	</div>

		<div class='col-md-6'>
		<p class='lead'>Get the results directly from SAP into Excel.</p>
		<p>
			<figure class='border'>
				<img src='img.php?src=script-results.png' alt='Script results' class='img-responsive center-block' />
				<figcaption class='text-center'>Image: View the script results.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

#### Time saved example
This graph represents actual data over the months of a year for one department of 25 people using the SAP Ribbon Add-In. Simply press the View statistics button to generate the source data for such a graph. 

<p>
	<figure class='border'>
		<img src='img.php?src=statisticsto2015.png' alt='Statistics graph' class='img-responsive center-block' />
		<figcaption class='text-center'>Image: Time saved in minutes, based on actual data. The bars represent objects updated.</figcaption>
	</figure>
</p>

Some time saved, huh!

#### We customize your solution
Every organization is unique, and has different needs. Which is why we customize your scripts according to yours. 

<hr>

#### Components in detail
* Usage statistics overview
* Customization according to your needs
* Custom error handling
* Database component for use with MS Access or SQLite.

#### Typical work process: 
You have some task that is repetative. It could be for example WBS closing in Project Builder, change a date somewhere, tick a checkbox, or even more advanced stuff, like the creation of purchase orders etc. 

Instead of working manually with such tasks, you record the steps in SAP on the first update. The recording contains all the steps required to do the update on that object. We rewrite it so it fits different system scenarios, and insert it into the SAP Ribbon program. 

Now, you click the play button and go and do something that actually requires a human :).

### Other Excel macros
Besides from integrating them in the Excel SAP Ribbon - perhaps you have an idea that you want to automate as an independent script? 

Perhaps one of the following:

* compare reports
* create graphs automatically
* generate reports based on data
* compile information in reports 
* synchronize MS Access database with Excel
* update MS Access database records or fetch information
* generate templates
* auto-send mails in Outlook
* insert appointments in calendar based on Excel data

* a combination of some of the above or something entirely else?

The possibilities of automation is limitless.

## Websites

Perhaps you need a website? To promote a product or a informal website for your company.

We can help you out with creating a website using our web template, or using a framework (Phalcon etc.) or CMS (Wordpress etc.) of your choice.
