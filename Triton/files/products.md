### Excel SAP Ribbon Add-In

Using our Excel Custom Ribbon template for creating SAP Scripts, SAP automation* has never been easier, and always available when you open Excel. 

##### Typical work process: 
You have some task that is repetative. It could be for example WBS closing in Project Builder, change a date, tick a checkbox, or the creation of purchase orders etc. 

You do a couple of updates manually, and realize that you will do this for weeks. 

Instead of working like that, you record the steps on the first update and then insert this recorded to our Add-In template, create some variables. And adapt for variances in the objects to be updated. 

Click the play button and go and do something more fun. 

The best part is that you do not need to be a experienced programmer to make and maintain these kind of scripts. It's that easy, everyone can do it.

*\*<sub>Your SAP system needs to have SAP Scripting installed and enabled. In almost all cases, it is. See the picture at the bottom of this page to see how it should look in your settings.</sub>* 

#### Running the scripts

It couldn't be easier. Let us guide you through the steps.

<div class='row script-preview'>
	<div class='col-md-6'>
		<p class='lead'>Generate a script template by choosing a script to run.</p>

		<p>
			<figure class='border'>
				<img src='img.php?src=select-script.png' alt='Select script' class='img-responsive center-block' />
				<figcaption class='text-center'>Image: Select a script.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			</p>
	</div>

	<div class='col-md-6'>
		<p class='lead'>Fill in the script template for as many objects you like.</p>

		<p>
			<figure class='border'>
				<img src='img.php?src=fill-in-script.png' alt='Fill in script' class='img-responsive center-block' />
				<figcaption class='text-center'>Image: Fill in the script.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</p>

	</div>

<div class='row script-preview'>
	<div class='col-md-6'>
		<p class='lead'>Click the run button.</p>

		<p>
			<figure class='border'>
				<img src='img.php?src=run-script.png' alt='Select script' class='img-responsive center-block' />
				<figcaption class='text-center'>Image: Run the script.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</p>

	</div>

		<div class='col-md-6'>
		<p class='lead'>Get the results directly from SAP into Excel.</p>

		<p>
			<figure class='border'>
				<img src='img.php?src=script-results.png' alt='Script results' class='img-responsive center-block' />
				<figcaption class='text-center'>Image: View the script results.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</p>

	</div>

#### Time saved example

This graph represents actual data over the months of a year for one department of 25 people using the SAP Ribbon Add-In.

<p>
	<figure class='border'>
		<img src='img.php?src=statisticsto2015.png' alt='Statistics graph' class='img-responsive center-block' />
		<figcaption class='text-center'>Image: Time saved in minutes, based on actual data. The bars represent objects updated.</figcaption>
	</figure>
</p>

Some time saved, huh!

#### Customize your solution

Let us set you up with the scripts you need - or let us *teach you* how to do create them. 

#### Components in detail

* Usage statistics overview
* Customization
* Custom error handling
* Code exporting (for i.e GitHub)
* Database component for use with MS Access

### Other Excel macros

Besides from integrating them in the Excel SAP Ribbon - perhaps you have an idea that you want to automate as an independent script? 

Perhaps one of the following:

* compare reports
* create graphs automatically
* generate reports based on data
* compile information
* synchronize MS Database with Excel
* update MS Access database records or fetch information
* generate templates
* auto-send mails in Outlook
* insert appointments in calendar based on Excel data

* a combination of some of the above or something entirely else?

The possibilities of automation is limitless. 

## Websites

Perhaps you need a website? To promote a product or a informal website for your company.

We can help you out with creating a website using our web template, or using a framework (Phalcon etc.) or CMS (Wordpress etc.) of your choice.
